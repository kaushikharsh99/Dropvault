# DropVault 🧠🔐

**Your AI-Powered, Private Second Brain.**

DropVault is a unified knowledge management system designed to capture, organize, and retrieve your digital life. It combines a seamless browser extension for instant capturing with a powerful, AI-driven local web dashboard for management and semantic search.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 Universal Capture:** Instantly save links, articles, images, and notes from anywhere on the web using the browser extension.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Search:** Don't just search for keywords. DropVault uses **semantic vector search** (via local embeddings) to find content based on *meaning* and context.
- **📄 Smart Extraction:**
    - **OCR:** Automatically extracts text from uploaded images.
    - **PDF Parsing:** Index and search through the content of your PDF documents.
    - **Auto-Tagging:** AI analyzes content to suggest relevant tags automatically.
- **🔒 Privacy First:** Your data logic and AI models run **locally** on your machine. We use Firebase only for secure authentication and file storage synchronization.
- **⚡ Modern Stack:** Built with React (Vite), Python (FastAPI + PyTorch), and Chrome Extension APIs.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`dropvault-website/`**: The main application.
  - **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS + ShadcnUI.
  - **Backend:** Python FastAPI server handling AI models, OCR, and database logic.
- **`dropvault-extension/`**: A Chromium-based browser extension to interact with the Vault from any tab.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **Python** (v3.10+)
- **Firebase Project** (for Auth & Storage)

### 1. Configure Environment

You need to set up your API keys before running the app.

1.  **Website:**
    ```bash
    cd dropvault-website
    cp .env.example .env
    # Open .env and paste your Firebase credentials
    ```
2.  **Extension:**
    ```bash
    cd ../dropvault-extension
    cp .env.example .env
    # Open .env and paste your Firebase credentials
    ```

### 2. One-Click Installation (Recommended)

We've provided a script to automatically install all frontend and backend dependencies, set up the virtual environment, and build the extension.

```bash
# From the project root
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

*(This may take a few minutes as it installs large AI libraries like PyTorch)*

### 3. Run the System

Launch the full application (Frontend + AI Backend) with a single command:

```bash
cd dropvault-website
python3 start_app.py
```

- **Frontend:** `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend:** `http://localhost:8000`

## 🧩 Installing the Browser Extension

2.  Toggle **"Developer mode"** (top right).
3.  Click **"Load unpacked"**.
4.  Select the **`dropvault-extension/dist`** folder.
